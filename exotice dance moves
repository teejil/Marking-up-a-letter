Polynesian chicken dance
A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300 BC, a whole village 
would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".
Icelandic brownian shuffle
Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance,
which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around 
in imperceptably tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought 
this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
Arctic robot dance
An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by
inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just
moving like this because they were really cold.
